## About the project
This is an app that gives you trivia questions and lets you store your high score locally!

### Languages Used:
- Javascript (jQuery)
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- HTML

## How to Use
The Trivia App works as follows:
1. On Welcome Page, read instructions and select START
2. Answer trivia questions! Incorrect Answers will take 5 seconds away from you (thus lowering your score)
3. Game will end after time runs out of after all 10 questions have been completed
4. After game ends, you will be prompted to add your initials to store your high score locally

## Future Scope:
- further enhance css
- upload larger list of questions
- randomize 10 questions
